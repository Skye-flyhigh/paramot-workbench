## Workflow Principles
- Each inspection is a separate, immutable record (versioned if edited/copied).
- Technician can review previous inspections for a glider, but new inspections always start blank or with explicit copy.
- All changes are tracked; nothing is overwritten.
- UI is modular, with each main section as a React component/page.
- Sidebar navigation for quick access to all sections.
- Header always shows the glider being serviced.
