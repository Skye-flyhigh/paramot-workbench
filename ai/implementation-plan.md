# paraMOT Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan follows a Safety-First Vertical Slice approach, optimized for real-world workshop constraints. Each slice delivers a complete, safety-validated feature while maximizing efficiency within the physical limitations of a workshop (single glider inspection space, limited workshop area). The focus is on minimizing technician input time while maintaining rigorous safety standards through validated defaults, efficient validation, and optimized single-glider workflows.
