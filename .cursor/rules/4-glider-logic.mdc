# Glider Logic – Trim, Line Strength, and Inspection Rules

## 1. Line Strength Assessment

### Load Distribution (APPI Table)
- For gliders with 4 rows (A–D): use [40%, 35%, 20%, 5%]
- For gliders with 3 rows: [50%, 40%, 10%]
- For 2 rows: [65%, 35%]
- Stabilo lines are not counted

### Destructive Test Thresholds:
- **Warning**: <20% of original strength → recheck in 50h or 100 flights
- **Reject**: <10% of original strength

### Non-Destructive Test Thresholds:
- Load test = 8G of Max TFW + 20% of strength range
- Line types:  
  - **Vectran**: recheck every 50h / 100 flights  
  - **Dyneema**: generally not tested unless suspicious  
  - **Aramid**: full-length test, tracked per line type

## 2. Trim Differential Calculation

### APPI Differential Method
- Compare A–B and A–C for each group (Inside, Mid, Out, Stabilo)
- Trim goal: bring differential close to **0mm**
- Adjust loops accordingly:
  - Reference is set to lowest point in group
  - Loop the others to match it (see "loops correct" tables)
  - Typical loop types: 1 loop (malion), 2 loops (lark’s foot), etc.

### APPI Airworthiness Trim Criteria
- Flat Aspect Ratio ≤5 → deviation limit 20mm (maintenance)
- ≤6 → 15mm
- ≤6.5 → 10mm
- >6.5 → 10mm max

## 3. Measurement Methods

### Laser Method (Worner, VLS)
- Measures total line length vs official specs
- Accuracy requires constant tension (recommended: 5 daN)
- Rail-based measurement has lower dispersion

### Differential Method
- Measures difference between cascades (A–B, A–C)
- Easier, faster, lower dispersion
- Tension evenly via ETT between 3–10 daN

## 4. Trim Profiles (Illustrative)
- Reflex profile = stable (C longest)
- Accelerated = B/C longer than A
- Slowed = B/C shorter
- Unstable = B longer, C shorter → avoid

## 5. Correction Engine Logic

- Detect loop presence visually
- Recommend loop additions per group
    - 1 = simple loop (shortens by approx 10mm)
    - 2 = double loop (shortens by approx 15mm)
    - 3 = lark's foot (shortens by approx 25mm)
    - 4 = lark's foot with an extra loop on maillon or upper cascade (shortens by approx 35mm)
    - 5 = lark's foot with an extra loop on maillon and upper cascade loop (shortens by approx 45mm)
- Update diagnostic table with:
  - Trim deviation
  - Suggested correction
  - Loop recommendation (count + method)
- Optionally, flag when overlooped and suggest removal

## 6. Cloth & Stitching Assessment

### Permeability (JDC)
- Measure 4 points across Z (leading edge)
- Discard cells <200 sec
- Check if coating loss corresponds to cloth stiffness loss

### Stitching
- Visual condition (OK, Warning, Critical)
- Optionally, mark repaired panels with zone and surface

## ⚠️ Notes
- Always double-check left/right group logic before applying loops
- Avoid mixing differential and total length methods without recalibration
- When APPI data is missing, default to caution: suggest rejection threshold at 20% strength
