# Known Issues to Handle

## Critical Safety Issues

### Measurement Validation
- PDF generator crashes when images are corrupted
- Unexpected trim results (flag if lines differ >10mm from ref)
- Technician error: missing measurement → show warning before report generation
- File write permissions on macOS sandboxed environment
- Manufacturer data version mismatch → prevent inspection start
- Invalid certification class data → block report generation
- Missing safety validation checkpoints → prevent session completion
- Corrupted measurement data → require revalidation

### Real-World Measurement Scenarios
- Line length anomalies in cascade groups
  - Wrong line mounted in wrong cascade position
  - Tabs showing inconsistent lengths
  - Cascade group misalignment
  - Line material mismatch
- Riser length inconsistencies
  - A risers shorter than B/C risers
  - Trim system affecting measurements
  - Tandem-specific trim variations
  - Back riser trimmer position impact
- Trim system variations
  - Tandem trim system differences
  - Back riser trimmer neutral position
  - Manufacturer-specific trim requirements
  - Trim system calibration impact
- Measurement tool issues
  - Laser measurement errors
  - Calibration drift
  - Environmental factors
  - Operator handling errors

### Manufacturer Data Edge Cases
- Age-related data inconsistencies
- Missing or outdated specifications
- Incomplete trim information
- Varying measurement protocols
- Inconsistent cascade data
- Missing trim system details
- Outdated material specs
- Incomplete riser information

## Prevention Strategies

### Measurement Validation
- Implement pre-session validation
- Add measurement cross-checking
- Create safety checkpoint verification
- Set up automatic data backup
- Implement session recovery
- Add validation state tracking
- Create measurement history verification
- Set up manufacturer data versioning

### Real-World Scenarios
- Line cascade verification
  - Visual cascade group check
  - Line material verification
  - Tab length comparison
  - Cascade position validation
- Riser system validation
  - Riser length comparison
  - Trim system position check
  - Tandem-specific validation
  - Back riser trimmer verification
- Measurement protocol
  - Laser calibration check
  - Environmental factor consideration
  - Operator training validation
  - Tool condition verification

### Manufacturer Data
- Version control for manufacturer data
- Regular data update checks
- Specification verification
- Protocol validation
- Material spec tracking
- Trim system documentation
- Cascade group verification
- Riser system validation

## Error Handling Priority

1. **Critical Safety**
   - Measurement validation failure
   - Line cascade misalignment
   - Riser system inconsistency
   - Trim system variation
   - Manufacturer data mismatch

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Session corruption
   - Measurement anomalies
   - Validation failures
   - Report generation issues

3. **User Experience**
   - Measurement guidance
   - Validation feedback
   - Safety narrative
   - Error recovery

## Recovery Procedures

### Measurement Recovery
- Re-measurement protocol
- Cascade group verification
- Riser system check

- Safety narrative support

## Validation Thresholds

### Line Measurements
- Cascade group deviation >10mm → warning
- Tab length variation >5mm → check
- Line material mismatch → block
- Wrong cascade position → block

### Riser System
- Riser length difference >15mm → warning
- Trim system position incorrect → check
- Tandem trim variation → verify
- Back riser trimmer position → validate

### General Measurements
- Laser measurement error >100mm → recheck
- Environmental impact → verify
- Tool calibration drift → recalibrate
- Operator error → retrain

- Back riser trimmer position
- Riser length variations
- Cascade group differences

### Trim Systems
- Neutral position verification
- Manufacturer-specific requirements
- Trim system calibration
- Riser length validation

### Manufacturer Variations
- Age-related specifications
- Protocol differences
- Material variations
- Trim system requirements
